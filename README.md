## Technical details
  
DISCLAIMER: each of this libraries is not mine, the authors are as stated in the links below, and they were only used in this work for academic purposes.  

To run this simulations it is necessary to have Tensorflow 2.0 installed, recommended to create a venv in the same folder as the source code:
[Official TF2 installation guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip#virtual-environment-install) (link accessed 08/2020)  
  
[Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/getting-started.html) is also an excellent tool for debuging the application.  
  
[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) was used for graphical results.

Baselines were made with [stable-baselines](https://github.com/hill-a/stable-baselines) which in turn was forked from OpenAI baselines, this ones need version 1.4 or 1.5 of Tensorflow to reproduce them.
